# COMP2110 Week 06

Briefly summarise the work you've done this week here.

Update the stylesheet
.
2. Implement a new element <page-footer> that shows the text "Copyright 2024 &copy; Your Name" (the entity &copy; should display as Â©).   Add a suitable stylesheet to the element.  (Copy the pageheader.js and modify it to complete this task).

3. Introduce a state property in the page footer element to hold the current year and use it in generating the content so that 2024 is generated from this property.  In the constructor of the class, initialise the year property to the current year using Date (your favourite search engine might help you to work out how to do that).
